This repo contains all the information needed for [WWC Seattle's workshop](http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Seattle/events/220649589/).

## Installation Notes

Tutorials will require the following:
- [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
  - Requires [R 2.11.1 (or higher)](http://cran.rstudio.com/)

Additional 'R' packages can be downloaded using CRAN in R:

```
> install.packages("package_name")
```

Thus, to install packages we will be using in this workshop:

```
# for creating RMDs
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("yaml")
install.packages("htmltools")
install.packages("caTools")
install.packages("bitops")
install.packages("rmarkdown")

# for data cleaning and shaping
install.packages("tidy")
install.packages("plyr")
install.packages("dplyr")

# for data exploration
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
